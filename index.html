                <p>
                    A Supernova explosion has happened in the Andromeda-our neighboring galaxy. The after-effects of the
                    Supernova are felt in our galaxy too and has caused a devastating cosmos disruption. All the
                    Spacecrafts have also been affected by this and some of them have lost their connection with the
                    Earth.
                    All the Nations have formed an alliance to recover the Spacecrafts. A Special Team has been formed
                    consisting of the worldâ€™s best- Cosmonauts, UAV Specialists and Tactical Specialists.
                    You are <b>Namikaze Minato</b>, A UAV Specialist from the Space Ops Team. You have been assigned the
                    task
                    of making sure the successful recovery of <b>Kyuubi TL-9</b>, which is one of the most expensive
                    spacecrafts equipped with advanced technologies and has its own A.I. programmed for proper handling
                    and functioning of the Spacecraft.It is known for the in-depth research, assessment and exploration
                    of outer space it can perform while still being unmanned.Due to the disruption,The connection with
                    the spacecraft is weakened and the A.I is malfunctioning,For safety reasons,The control was switched
                    from auto-pilot to manual control.
                    Your Task is to handle the Kyuubi TL-9 and navigate it through the outer space until the connection
                    is formed again. It is assumed that this task is nearly impossible, So the top priority task you
                    have is to handle the spacecraft until the technical team manages to retrieve the data.
                    Get Ready,Begin your journey and accomplish the task.
                    Use <b>ARROW KEYS</b> for maneuvering the SpaceCraft. <br><b>Arrow Left</b> to <b>dodge left</b> and
                    <b>Arrow Right</b> to <b>dodge right</b>.
